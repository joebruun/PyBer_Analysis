# PyBer Analysis

## Overview/Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to use the data from large csv files to provide PyBer with a useful and conclusive analysis that showcases the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fare, riders, and drivers by type of city to help PyBer inprove access to ride sharing services and determine affodrability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Analysis/Results

### Rural Cities

For rural city types, they generate the least overall in total fares and have the least aount of riders and drivers. However, they do have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. 

### Suburban Cities

For suburban city types, they sit in between the data for rural and urban city types. Suburban city types have the second most riders and drivers, and also generates the second most per ride and per driver. 

### Urban Cities

For urban city types, they have the largest number of total riders, drivers, fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. While they lead these categories, urban cities are last in the average fare per ride and the averafe fare per driver.

As shown in the image below, it seems that there is no correlation between the total fares in a type of city by month.

## Summary/Recommendations for CEO

- For urban city types, there are very many drivers and even more drivers than riders. To fix this problem, the PyBer CEO could advertise their product to more individuals in urban areas, or they could decrease the amount of drivers available in urban cities. 
- Create incentives or discounts for either drivers, riders, or both to improve and encourage more riders, increasin total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per drivers for rural city types. 
- To improve urban city types, the CEO could implement a "busy hour" price that is in effect during the busiest hours for drivers. This would help improve the average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
